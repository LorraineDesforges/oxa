Automation consists in the use of softwares to create replicable commands and workflows, with the aim of reducing human intervention or substituting it with automated computing systems.

In the OXA project, automation will be used to enrich, accelerate or replace human actions and provide greater scope or efficiency (notably by proposing the possibility to automate complex orchestrated response plans).

To do so, OXA members will rely on the OpenC2 standard. Open C2 is a standardized language to send  commands and control messages to technologies that provide or support cyberdefense. 
With OpenC2, security professionals shall be able to automatically execute various tactical threat responses across a wide range of technologies at machine speed.
